This repository contains code for all the simulations presented in the paper:

Thunderstruck: The ACDC model of flexible sequences and rhythms in recurrent neural circuits
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.07.438842v1

All simulations can be run independently, but have however some dependencies:

To succesfully run simulations 1-6,8 and 9, the associated python files must be situated in a folder containing the .txt files within
the folder "Weights Simulations 1-6 and 8-9". These files correspond to the learnt weights that can also be obtained by running Simulation 1.
The same applies for Simulations 7 and the folfer "Weights Simulations 7".

To recreate the Audio 1 and 2 simulations the .wav files within the "Notes for Sound simulations" need to be in the same folder 
where the Simulation 7 - Audio file 1/2...py files are run from.

To recreate videos 1 and 2, each simulation .py file must be in a folder containing the files within the video 1 and 2 folders, respectively.
Additionaly, for video 1, this folder must also contain the files in the folder "Weights Simulations 7". Note finally that the pca.rar has to be unziped.
